            <p>
              Welcome to Sourcerer! These terms and conditions ("Terms") govern

              (collectively, the "Services"). By accessing or using our
              Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not
              agree to these Terms, you may not use our Services.
            </p>
            <h6>1. Acceptance of Terms</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>

                By accessing or using our Services, you confirm that you have
                read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you
                are using the Services on behalf of a company or other legal
                entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind that
                entity to these Terms. In such cases, "you" and "your" will
                refer to both you and the entity.
              </li>
              <li>

                platform. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we
                modify them, as your continued use of the Services after the

                <b> Severability </b>
                If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of
                competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall
                not affect the validity of the remaining provisions, which shall
                remain in full force and effect.

                <b> No Waiver: </b>
                No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further
                or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and
                Sourcerer’s failure to assert any right or provision under these
                Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
