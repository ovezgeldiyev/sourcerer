                we take steps to ensure that your information is protected in
                accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law. These
                steps may include entering into data transfer agreements that
                incorporate standard contractual clauses approved by the
                European Commission or relying on other legal transfer
                mechanisms such as the Privacy Shield framework or adequacy
                decisions.
